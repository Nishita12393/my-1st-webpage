    <p>The assignment of module csy1018 is to make a webpage which contain five pages i.e. Home, Portfolio ,Contact , CV , Sitereport . At the beginning its very hard for me to cope with web development as it includes coding , design ,HTML ,CSS etc which is very new for me .But our module teacher has good way of teaching and that make me ease throughout my learning process but still i lack in many things .HTML is a way easier than css because we need to make our page look good through css as we want .Our teacher didnt teach us all the properties we need to use in css and this make me a little difficult as I need to explore on my own through different means.</p><br>
